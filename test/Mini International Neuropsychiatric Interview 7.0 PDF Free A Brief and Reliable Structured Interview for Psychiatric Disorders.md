# What is the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and how to access it?
 
The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed jointly by psychiatrists and clinicians in the United States and Europe, for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders[^1^]. With an administration time of approximately 15 minutes, it was designed to meet the need for a short but accurate structured psychiatric interview for multicenter clinical trials and epidemiology studies and to be used as a first step in outcome tracking in nonresearch clinical settings[^1^].
 
The MINI has several versions, including the MINI-Plus, which covers 23 disorders, the MINI-Screen, which screens for 14 disorders, and the MINI-Kid, which is adapted for children and adolescents[^2^]. The MINI has been translated into more than 40 languages and has been validated against other diagnostic instruments such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, Patient Version (SCID-P), the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), and expert professional opinion[^1^].

The MINI is a useful tool for clinicians and researchers who need a brief and reliable diagnostic interview for psychiatric disorders. It can help improve the quality of care and the validity of data in various settings.
  
## Benefits and limitations of the MINI
 
The MINI has several benefits as a diagnostic tool for psychiatric disorders. Some of these benefits are:
 
- It is brief and easy to administer, requiring only 15 minutes on average[^1^]. This makes it suitable for busy clinical settings and large-scale studies.
- It is fully structured and standardized, reducing the variability and subjectivity of diagnosis across different interviewers and settings[^1^].
- It covers a wide range of psychiatric disorders according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria, allowing for the detection of comorbidities and differential diagnosis[^1^].
- It has good reliability and validity compared to other diagnostic instruments such as the SCID-P and the CIDI[^1^] [^3^].
- It is well accepted by patients, general practitioners and therapists, who find it useful, non-intrusive and helpful for recognizing and verbalizing their problems[^2^].
- It can facilitate appropriate treatment planning and outcome evaluation by providing a clear diagnosis and severity rating[^2^].

However, the MINI also has some limitations that should be considered. Some of these limitations are:

- It focuses on the current presence of disorders and does not explore their onset, duration, course or remission[^1^]. This may limit its usefulness for longitudinal studies or chronic conditions.
- It does not assess the severity, disability or medical causes of symptoms in detail, which may affect the clinical management and prognosis of patients[^1^].
- It has a yes-no format that may not capture the complexity and variability of psychiatric symptoms across different individuals and cultures[^2^].
- It may have lower sensitivity or specificity for some disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and bulimia[^1^].
- It requires training and supervision to ensure its proper administration and interpretation[^2^].

Therefore, the MINI should be used as a complement to the clinical judgment and not as a substitute for it. The MINI should also be adapted to the specific needs and context of each patient and setting.
