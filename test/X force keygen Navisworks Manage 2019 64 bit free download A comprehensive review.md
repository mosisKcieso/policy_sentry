## How to Use Navisworks Manage 2019
 
Navisworks Manage 2019 is a powerful tool that allows you to review and coordinate your BIM projects. You can use it to perform tasks such as:

- Open and combine 3D models from different formats and disciplines.
- Navigate and explore the models using different views and tools.
- Create and manage clash tests to identify and resolve conflicts between elements.
- Create and edit animations, renderings, and simulations to communicate your design intent.
- Create and manage markups, comments, and redlines to collaborate with your team.
- Create and export reports, schedules, and data tables to document your project.

In this section, we will give you a brief overview of how to use some of the main features of Navisworks Manage 2019.
 
### Opening and Combining Models
 
Navisworks Manage 2019 can open and combine models from various file formats, such as DWG, DWF, NWC, NWD, IFC, RVT, SKP, FBX, and more. You can also import data from other sources, such as Excel spreadsheets, databases, point clouds, and laser scans.
 
To open a model, you can either click on the "Open" button on the ribbon or drag and drop the file into the Navisworks window. You can also use the "Append" button to add more models to the current one. You can also use the "Merge" button to combine two or more models into a single file.
 
Once you have opened or combined your models, you can use the "Selection Tree" tab on the left panel to view and manage the hierarchy of the elements. You can also use the "Properties" tab to view and edit the attributes of the selected elements. You can also use the "Sets" tab to create and manage groups of elements based on criteria such as name, type, layer, color, etc.
 
### Navigating and Exploring Models
 
Navisworks Manage 2019 provides various tools and options to navigate and explore your models. You can use the "ViewCube" on the top right corner of the window to rotate and orient your model. You can also use the "Navigation Bar" on the bottom right corner of the window to zoom, pan, orbit, walk, fly, or look around your model. You can also use the "SteeringWheels" on the bottom left corner of the window to access more navigation options.
 
You can also use the "Viewpoints" tab on the right panel to create and manage custom views of your model. You can also use the "Sectioning" tool on the ribbon to cut through your model and view its internal details. You can also use the "Measure" tool on the ribbon to measure distances, angles, areas, volumes, etc. in your model.
 
### Creating and Managing Clash Tests
 
Navisworks Manage 2019 allows you to create and manage clash tests to identify and resolve conflicts between elements in your model. You can use the "Clash Detective" tab on the right panel to access this feature. You can also use the "Test" button on the ribbon to create a new clash test.
 
To create a clash test, you need to specify two sets of elements that you want to compare. You can either select them from the selection tree or create them using rules or filters. You also need to specify the type of clash test (hard or clearance) and the tolerance value (the minimum distance between elements that is considered a clash).
 
After creating a clash test, you can run it by clicking on the "Run Test" button on the ribbon. You will see a list of clashes in the clash detective tab. You can click on each clash to view its details and location in the model. You can also assign statuses (new, active, reviewed, approved) and comments to each clash. You can also group clashes by criteria such as level, discipline, severity, etc.
 
You can also use the "Switchback" button on the ribbon to open the source application (such as AutoCAD or Revit) and edit the elements that are causing clashes. You can then refresh your model in Navisworks Manage 2019 and rerun your clash test to see if they are resolved.
