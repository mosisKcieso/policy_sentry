\*\*How to Design and Size PV Systems with ACCA Solarius PV 7 104\*\*  If you are looking for a software that can help you design and size photovoltaic systems according to your specific needs, you might want to check out ACCA Solarius PV 7 104. This software is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that allows you to create any type of PV system starting from scratch or from an existing BIM model. In this article, we will review some of the features and benefits of using ACCA Solarius PV 7 104 for your solar projects.  
## 3D/BIM Modelling
 One of the main advantages of ACCA Solarius PV 7 104 is that it supports 3D/BIM modelling. This means that you can design your PV system in a realistic and accurate way, taking into account the geometry, orientation, and materials of the building. You can also import an existing BIM model from AutoCAD Â® DXF/DWG file or from Edificius, Revit Â® , ArchiCAD Â® or IFC format[^1^]. This way, you can save time and avoid errors by working on a single digital model.  
## Solar Shading Analysis
 Another important feature of ACCA Solarius PV 7 104 is that it considers solar shading due to long-distance obstacles such as mountains, hills, buildings, trees, etc. It does this by simply taking a photograph and displaying the solar diagram at the installation site[^2^]. This helps you to optimize the position and orientation of the PV modules and maximize the solar irradiation. Moreover, ACCA Solarius PV 7 104 allows you to see the effect of shading on PV modules by nearby obstacles such as walls, chimneys, antennas, etc. by using a 3D view or a video animation[^2^]. This way, you can evaluate the impact of shading on the energy production and performance of your PV system.  
## Electrical Design and Calculation
 ACCA Solarius PV 7 104 also helps you with the electrical design and calculation of your PV system. It automatically generates the single-line electrical diagram of the system, including all the components such as inverters, cables, fuses, switches, etc. It also calculates the electrical parameters such as voltage, current, power, losses, etc. according to the international standards and regulations[^1^]. You can also customize the electrical components and their characteristics according to your preferences and needs.  
## Economic Analysis and Report
 Finally, ACCA Solarius PV 7 104 provides you with a comprehensive economic analysis and report of your PV system. It calculates the costs and revenues of the system over its lifetime, taking into account factors such as incentives, tariffs, taxes, maintenance, etc. It also estimates the payback period, the net present value (NPV), the internal rate of return (IRR), and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of your system[^1^]. You can also compare different scenarios and options to find the best solution for your project. Moreover, ACCA Solarius PV 7 104 generates a detailed and professional report that includes all the technical and economic data of your system, as well as graphs, tables, images, etc. You can export the report in PDF or DOCX format or print it directly from the software[^1^].  
## Conclusion
 ACCA Solarius PV 7 104 is a software that can help you design and size photovoltaic systems according to your specific needs. It offers you features such as 3D/BIM modelling, solar shading analysis, electrical design and calculation, economic analysis and report. It is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can save you time and money while ensuring quality and accuracy for your solar projects.
